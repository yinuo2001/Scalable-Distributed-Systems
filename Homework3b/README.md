# Homework 3b: Simple Performance

1. Experiment with a simple load test with a servlet
2. Build a multithreaded servlet client using the Apache HttpClient library

**Observation:**
- Tomcatâ€™s maxThreads is the bottleneck
- Excess requests must wait in a queue, causing delay

Observing the live threads number, I noticed that when the incoming request is fewer than Tomcat's maximum thread number, live threads have a positive corelation with incoming request number. However, when incoming request exceed that threshold, the live thread number will likely to be steady.
